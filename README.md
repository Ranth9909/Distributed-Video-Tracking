# Distributed-Video-Tracking
My Final Year Project as a Computer Engineering student in Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS. The system works but more work and progress are encouraged. 

## Project Details
The project would utilize OpenCV for capturing devices, TensorFlow object detection API (Faster-RCNN) and SORT for tracking the person in a video input. It is built upon the Siamese Neural Network.

This project can be divided into two main algorithms:
1. Pedestrian detection and tracking (Collect_Train_data.py)
2. Person Reidentifying (Test_Train_data.py)

## Notice!
This project has loose inspiration from Nicholas Renotte. For better understanding of the written codes, please first watch his Youtube playlist on "Build a Facial Recognition App // Deep Learning Project // Paper2Code Series". This will provide insights for the PATHS and Directory. 

I have also written an indepth report, where I explained the working principle of the proposed system. You can find it in the repository, "Sharranth_16002514.pdf"
