# Distributed-Video-Tracking
My Final Year Project as a Computer Engineering student in Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS. It is still in it's beginning stage, hence more work and progress has to be done.
## Project Details
This project can be divided into two main algorithms:
1. Pedestrian detection and tracking (Collect_Train_data.py)
2. Person Reidentifying (Test_Train_data.py)

The project would utilize OpenCV for capturing devices, TensorFlow object detection API (Faster-RCNN) and SORT for tracking the person during a video input. It is built upon the Siamese Neural Network.

## Notice!
This project has loose inspiration from Nicholas Renotte. For better understanding of the written codes, please first watch his Youtube playlist on "Build a Facial Recognition App // Deep Learning Project // Paper2Code Series". 

I have also written an indepth report, where I explained the working principle of the proposed system.
